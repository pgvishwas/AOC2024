Advent of Code 2024 Solutions 🎄✨

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! This is where I solve daily programming puzzles using Python 3 during the AoC competition. The challenges are a great way to practice problem-solving, improve coding skills, and have fun during the holiday season! 🎅
What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that are released daily from December 1st to December 25th. Participants solve the puzzles in their preferred programming language and aim to improve their problem-solving and algorithmic skills.
Repository Structure

This repository is organized by day, with each day's puzzle stored in its own folder:

├── Day01/
│   ├── input.txt       # Puzzle input for Day 1
│   ├── solution.py     # Python solution for Day 1
│   └── README.md       # Explanation of the solution
├── Day02/
│   ├── input.txt
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── README.md
...
├── README.md           # This file
└── utils/              # Utility functions for common tasks (e.g., parsing input)

Why Python?

I chose Python for its simplicity, readability, and powerful built-in libraries that make it well-suited for algorithmic challenges. With Python, I can focus on solving the problem rather than worrying about low-level implementation details.
